# Emotion-Recognition-Based-on-EEG-Signals
This repository is the summary of my works of the Emotion Recognition. These works were done by myself as a member of the [BCMI lab](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervise of [Prof.Lu Baoliang](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/) during my undergraduate study.

The data are either public or non-public. I have marked the resource of them.

The processed data are mainly the Differential Entropy, Power Spectrum Density and other useful features extracted from the original EEG/EOG data.

#### This models described in this reprository are:
- convLSTM,
- SVM,
- Deep Brief Network
- Restricted Boltzmann Machine
- Random Forest
(to be continuing updated)
